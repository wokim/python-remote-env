# Python Remote Environment

Python Remote Environment lets you use a Docker container as a full-featured development environment in Visual Studio Code.

- Beyond the advantages of having your team use a consistent environment and tool-chain, this also makes it easier for new contributors or team members to be productive quickly.
- First-time contributors will require less guidance and hit fewer issues related to environment setup.

This environment is based on the [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)

### Download PowerLine fonts

```sh
# clone
git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git --depth=1

# install
cd fonts
./install.sh

# clean-up a bit
cd ..
rm -rf fonts
```

### Git configuration

```sh
git config --global user.name "name"
git config --global user.email account@yourdomain.com
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain

$ git config --list
user.name=Kim, Wonshik
user.email=wokim@mycelebs.com
credential.helper=osxkeychain
```

## How to use

By including `devcontainer.json` files in your repository, anyone that opens a local copy of your repo in VS Code will be automatically prompted to reopen the folder in a container, provided they have the Remote - Containers extension installed. You can also try it with `Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container` in the Command Palette (`F1`).
